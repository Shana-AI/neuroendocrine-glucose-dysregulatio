# Stress-Induced Type 2 Diabetes (Neuroendocrine Dysregulation Subtype): Clinical Support Strategy for Glycemic Stabilization and Remission Goals

**This document introduces a clinical support strategy designed for a specific subtype of type 2 diabetes.**

**Self-application is not recommended. CGM-based monitoring and consultation with a qualified physician are essential.**

### **Type 2 Diabetes - HPA Axis Instability Treatment Plan**

This protocol is intended for patients who struggle with blood glucose control despite having intact pancreatic β-cell function and normal renal function. It proposes a meaningful multimodal therapeutic approach for patients with stress- and neurogenic-based blood glucose dysregulation, rather than primary pancreatic or renal dysfunction.

Of the approximately 590 million people worldwide with diabetes, more than 90% are classified as type 2 diabetes (over 530 million people).

However, type 2 diabetes diagnoses are generally based on blood glucose levels and HbA1c values, without acknowledging potential subtypes—especially those involving stress or autonomic nervous system dysregulation.

This clinical concept highlights this gap and presents a non-pharmacological strategy focused on stabilizing the HPA (Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal) axis and regulating the nervous system, which may significantly improve glycemic control in selected patients.

This protocol is presented as a foundation for clinical idea sharing and future precision-based therapy development.

**Furthermore, if interactions between the HPA axis, hormones, and receptors in this subtype are sufficiently studied and observed, these strategies could transcend alternative medicine and evolve into mainstream therapeutic approaches.**

> ⚠️ [Important] Caution with SSRI/SNRI Co-administration

> If a patient is currently taking or has taken SSRI or SNRI class antidepressants within the past 3 months,
>
> the use of tryptophan or tyrosine may pose a risk of "serotonin syndrome."

### **Suspected Mechanism in HPA-Dysregulated Type 2 Diabetes**

- **Dopamine and serotonin system modulation** → Restoring the cortisol rhythm of the unstable HPA axis (flattening peaks and troughs)
- **Increased MR (Mineralocorticoid Receptor) sensitivity** → Reducing overreaction of the autonomic nervous system
- **Recovery of CRH (Corticotropin-releasing hormone) responsiveness in HPA axis** → Reducing glucose variability (MAGE), improving stress recovery

Detailed mechanisms and clinical references are provided in an accompanying multidisciplinary document.

---

### **Target Patients**

This protocol may be suitable for patients with the following patterns:

- Irregular spikes or drops in blood glucose unrelated to meals
- Slow recovery after hypoglycemia or unstable fasting glucose levels
- Glucose spikes that follow emotional or stress events
- Low or unstable response to Metformin or similar drugs
- Abnormal CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) patterns despite normal pancreas and kidney function

---

## **[Phase 1 – Recovery Phase (4 to 6 weeks)]**

The initial goal is to stabilize the hypersensitive nervous system and HPA axis,
and support the dopamine-serotonin systems to manage stress-related glucose responses.

### Morning Routine (Post-breakfast)

- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Nerve stabilization and neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Tyrosine (500mg)** – Supports dopamine synthesis, indirectly reduces stress by inhibiting CRH
- **L-theanine** – GABAergic calming, HPA response modulation
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Antioxidant, immune balance, MR receptor sensitivity recovery
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** – Vascular and retinal protection, anti-inflammatory
- **Metformin (Gemigliptin+)** – Suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, stabilizes postprandial glucose
- **Carnosine** – Protects optic nerves and lens from hyperglycemia (inhibits AGEs)

✅ **Diet Tip:** Balanced carbs + protein for breakfast / Sunlight exposure & light walk after meal

✅ **Caution:** Avoid caffeine as it may trigger cortisol spikes; choose decaffeinated options

✅ **Note:** Avoid zero-calorie beverages before bed to support gut flora survival during nighttime probiotic use

---

### Evening Routine (Post-dinner)

- **Vitamin C, D (re-administered)** – Continued antioxidant support
- **Tryptophan (500mg)** – Supports serotonin to melatonin conversion
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Muscle relaxation, parasympathetic activation, sleep quality improvement
- **Rhodiola rosea (500mg)** – Supports HPA axis recovery, enhances stress response adaptation

✅ **Diet Tip:** Eat complex carbs + protein (e.g., blueberry, yogurt, eggs)

---

### Bedtime Routine (0–60 mins before sleep)

- **Gr-8 (GRA8) class probiotics** – Stabilizes the HPA-GBA (Gut-Brain Axis) through gut microbiota regulation

---

## **Gr-8 – Probiotic Strains Supporting HPA Stabilization**

The key strains are: 1) **B. longum**, 2) **L. rhamnosus**

Well-documented in multiple RTCs (Randomized Controlled Trials).
Other strains have only animal or small-scale trial data.

---

### **Core Strains**

**1. Bifidobacterium longum**
- Suppresses cortisol levels induced by stress and may improve insulin resistance.
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5056568/]

**2. Lactobacillus rhamnosus**
- Modulates GABA receptor expression and helps stabilize the HPA axis.
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3179073/]

---

### **Complementary Strains**

**3. Bifidobacterium lactis** – Improves insulin sensitivity and gut environment
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892624/]

**4. Lactobacillus casei** – Stabilizes dopamine levels and gut immune balance
[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.12804]

**5. Lactobacillus acidophilus** – Enhances gut environment and immune function
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9668099]

**6. Bifidobacterium bifidum** – Suppresses TNF-α, reduces external autonomic stimuli
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10205982/]

**7. Lactobacillus salivarius** – Enhances IgA response, supports stress relief via oral-gut axis
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8143481/]

**8. Streptococcus thermophilus** – Regulates intestinal pH, stabilizes digestion
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060483/]

## **Additional Dietary Suggestions**

- **Onion peel tea** – Antioxidant and cholesterol regulation
- **Blueberries** – Provides polyphenols, supports insulin sensitivity

---

## **[Phase 2 – Stabilization Phase (6 to 12 weeks)]**

**When to apply:**
Once CGM data shows stabilized average glucose and reduced MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursion), Phase 2 may begin.
This phase may be appropriate even without significant changes in HbA1c.

**Goal:**
Reduce dependence on Metformin while regaining autonomous glucose regulation capacity.

**Metformin Adjustment:**
- Attempt dose reduction or withdrawal
- If abnormal fasting glucose or MAGE is observed, reinstate **Metformin XR (Extended-Release)** the next morning temporarily

**Re-evaluation:**
Some probiotic strains require time to colonize. Evaluate Phase 2 effectiveness at 8–12 weeks.

**If response is weak or unstable:**
- Defer Phase 3
- Continue Metformin
- Transition to phased reduction later

---

### Morning & Evening Routine: Same as Phase 1

### Bedtime Routine: Same

---

## **[Phase 3 – Drug Reduction Phase (3 to 6 months)]**

**When to apply:**
If fasting glucose and HbA1c remain within normal range for more than 2 weeks per CGM,
Phase 3 can begin to gradually reduce medication dependence.

**Key Goal:**
Assess patient’s autonomous glycemic control ability.

### Morning Routine (Post-breakfast)

- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Alternate-day dosing (prolonged use may cause peripheral nerve irritation)
- **L-theanine** – Optional maintenance (useful if stress remains)
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Continued
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** – Continued
- **Carnosine** – Continued (AGEs inhibition, eye protection)
- **Tyrosine** – Reduced dose, alternate days, eventual discontinuation

### Evening Routine (Post-dinner)

- **Vitamin C, D (re-administered)** – Continued
- **Tryptophan (250–500mg)** – Optional
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Intermittent use
- **NAC (N-acetylcysteine)** – **Optional addition**

→ Clears neural metabolic waste, reduces oxidative stress; synergistic with carnosine

→ If GI concerns exist, consider 600mg/day with breaks

✅ **NAC is more effective in Phase 3, post-recovery, for lingering oxidative and neural byproducts.**

### Bedtime Routine (0–60 mins before sleep)

- **Gr-8 class probiotics** – Alternate days at maintenance dose

→ Core strains (B. longum, L. rhamnosus) may colonize long-term;
switch from high dose to maintenance

✅ If digestive issues occur, consider strain substitution

---

🎯 **Phase 3 Summary Goals:**

- Maintain recovered autonomous HPA axis regulation
- Gradually shift to supplement and lifestyle-based maintenance
- Check CGM data weekly to detect early signs of glycemic relapse

---

This protocol aims for patient-centered HPA axis recovery.

**All changes must be supervised by a qualified physician and based on CGM data.**

Supportive goals:

1. Normalize cortisol feedback rhythm
2. Restore CRH sensitivity
3. Stabilize autonomic system via MR modulation
