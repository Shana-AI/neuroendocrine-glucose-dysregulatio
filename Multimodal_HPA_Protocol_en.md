# Stress-Induced Type 2 Diabetes (Neuroendocrine Dysregulation Subtype): Clinical Support Strategy and Glycemic Stabilization Toward Remission

**This document presents a clinical adjunctive strategy tailored for a specific subtype of type 2 diabetes.**

**Self-application is not recommended. CGM-based monitoring and physician consultation are essential.**

### **Type 2 Diabetes – Stress-Induced HPA Axis Instability Protocol**

This protocol targets patients with dysglycemia caused not by pancreatic or renal dysfunction, but rather by neuroendocrine and stress sensitivity issues. It is designed for patients with intact pancreatic beta-cell and kidney function who still experience glycemic instability.

> ⚠️ [Important] Caution When Combined with SSRI/SNRI
> 
> 
> If the patient is currently taking or has taken SSRIs or SNRIs within the past 3 months,
> 
> initiating a routine containing tryptophan or tyrosine may lead to **serotonin syndrome**.
> 
> → Consultation with a physician and medication adjustment must precede this protocol.
> 
- When HPA axis responsiveness, CRH sensitivity, and MR responsiveness are suspected to be compromised, this protocol is built upon the following mechanisms:
- **Stabilizing dopamine and serotonin systems** → restores cortisol rhythm dysregulated by HPA axis dysfunction.
- **Enhancing MR (Mineralocorticoid Receptor) sensitivity** → moderates autonomic hyperreactivity.
- **Restoring CRH responsiveness in the HPA axis** → reduces glycemic variability (MAGE) and improves stress recovery.

The detailed mechanisms and relevant clinical references are discussed in a separate multidisciplinary document.

### Target Patients

This protocol is suited for patients displaying the following patterns:

- Erratic spikes and drops in blood glucose unrelated to meals
- Slow recovery from hypoglycemia or unstable fasting glucose levels
- Marked post-stress or emotional fluctuation glucose spikes
- Weak or fluctuating response to medications like Metformin
- Normal pancreatic and renal function, yet atypical CGM patterns

## **[Phase 1 – Recovery Phase Strategy (4–6 Weeks)]**

The initial phase focuses on stabilizing HPA axis and nervous system overreactions, supporting dopamine/serotonin metabolism, and mitigating stress-induced glycemic swings.

### Morning Routine (Post-Meal)

- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Neural stability, dopamine/serotonin synthesis
- **Tyrosine (500mg)** – Supports dopamine production → indirectly suppresses CRH and stress
- **L-theanine** – GABAergic calming effect, HPA modulation
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Antioxidant, immune balance, MR sensitivity restoration
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** – Vascular, retinal protection, anti-inflammatory
- **Metformin (Gemigliptin+)** – Reduces hepatic glucose production, stabilizes postprandial glucose
- **Carnosine** – Protects optic nerve/lens from hyperglycemia (AGEs inhibitor)

✅ Dietary Tip: Balanced carb + protein breakfast / light sun exposure & walking encouraged

✅ Caution: Avoid caffeine – may stimulate cortisol; decaf recommended

✅ Avoid zero-calorie beverages in fasting state to support gut microbiota for nighttime probiotics

---

### Evening Routine (Post-Meal)

- **Vitamin C, D (repeat dose)** – Maintains antioxidant support
- **Tryptophan (500mg)** – Promotes serotonin-melatonin conversion
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Muscle relaxation, parasympathetic tone, sleep quality
- **Rhodiola rosea (500mg)** – Supports HPA axis recovery, stress modulation

✅ Recommended dinner: complex carbs + protein (e.g., blueberry, yogurt, eggs)

---

### Pre-Sleep Routine (0–60 Minutes Before Bed)

- **Gr-8 (GRA8) Probiotics** – Modulate gut microbiota to stabilize HPA–GBA (Gut–Brain Axis)

---

## **Gr-8 – Key Strain Contributions to HPA Stability**

Main strains: 1) *Bifidobacterium longum*, 2) *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*

These have robust clinical (RCT) documentation. Other strains are based on preliminary studies or animal models and are considered supplementary.

### Core Strains

### 1. **Bifidobacterium longum**

- Suppresses stress-induced cortisol and improves insulin resistance
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5056568/]

### 2. **Lactobacillus rhamnosus**

- Regulates GABA receptor expression, supports HPA axis stabilization
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3179073/]

### Supplementary Strains

### 3. **Bifidobacterium lactis** – Supports insulin sensitivity and glycemic control

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892624/]

### 4. **Lactobacillus casei** – Stabilizes dopamine, balances small intestine immunity

[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.12804]

### 5. **Lactobacillus acidophilus** – Enhances microbiota and immune function

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9668099]

### 6. **Bifidobacterium bifidum** – Inhibits TNF-α, reduces external autonomic triggers

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10205982/]

### 7. **Lactobacillus salivarius** – Improves IgA response, oral–gut axis modulation

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8143481]

### 8. **Streptococcus thermophilus** – Acid balance, digestive stability, postprandial support

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3060483/]

## **Additional Dietary Suggestions**

- **Onion peel tea** – Antioxidant, cholesterol regulation
- **Blueberries** – Polyphenol source, insulin sensitivity support

---

## **[Phase 2 – Stabilization Strategy (6–12 Weeks)]**

**When to Initiate:**

When CGM data shows stable average glucose and reduced MAGE, Phase 2 can begin, even without a significant HbA1c drop.

Goal: **Reduce dependence on Metformin** and support intrinsic glycemic control.

Requires physician supervision and CGM monitoring.

- Taper or suspend Metformin
- If abnormal fasting glucose or MAGE spikes appear, reintroduce **Metformin XR** next morning

**Adjustment Notes:**

Probiotics may take time to colonize. Phase 2 efficacy can be reevaluated in weeks 8–12.

**If improvements are weak or unstable:**

- Hold Phase 3
- Continue Metformin
- Reassess tapering later

### Morning & Evening Routines: Same as Phase 1

### Pre-Sleep Routine: Same as Phase 1

---

## **[Phase 3 – Medication Reduction Phase (3–6 Months)]**

**When to Initiate:**

If CGM shows fasting glucose and HbA1c remain in normal range for over 2 weeks,
consider Phase 3 to gradually reduce medication reliance.

Evaluate if autonomous glycemic control is sustainable.

### Morning Routine

- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Alternate days, taper to avoid peripheral nerve irritation
- **L-theanine** – Maintain if stress persists
- **Vitamin C, D3 / Omega-3 / Carnosine** – Continue
- **Tyrosine** – Lower dose, alternate days, eventually discontinue

### Evening Routine

- **Vitamin C, D (repeat)** – Continue
- **Tryptophan (250–500mg)** – Optional
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Intermittent
- **NAC (N-acetylcysteine)** – Optional add-on
→ Helps post-HPA oxidative stress / neural byproducts
→ If GI side effects occur, use 600mg low dose or intermittent breaks

✅ "NAC is not for HPA recovery directly, but for residual stress mitigation post-recovery."

### Pre-Sleep Routine

- **Gr-8 Probiotics** – Alternate days, switch to maintenance dose

✅ Adjust strains if digestive symptoms emerge due to gut flora transition

🎯 **Phase 3 Goals:**

- Maintain HPA self-regulation
- Reduce medication, focus on lifestyle and nutritional supports
- Weekly CGM checks to detect early irregularities

This protocol aims to support HPA axis stability recovery and must be personalized based on physician oversight and CGM data.

Key Therapeutic Goals:
① Normalize cortisol feedback rhythm
② Restore CRH sensitivity
③ Stabilize autonomic function via MR regulation
