**Type 2 Diabetes – Stress-Induced HPA Axis Dysregulation Protocol**

This protocol presents a supportive, multimodal therapeutic approach for patients with a stress-neurogenic subtype of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), characterized by impaired glycemic regulation despite normal pancreatic beta-cell and renal function.

It is particularly suited to cases where blood glucose dysregulation stems from neuroendocrine and autonomic hypersensitivity rather than pancreatic or renal dysfunction.

**Note on SSRI/SNRI Antidepressant Use**

**Clinical caution is required. The simultaneous administration of tryptophan and tyrosine (used in this protocol) with SSRIs or SNRIs may trigger serotonin syndrome and pose serious health risks.**

This protocol is designed on the basis of observed or suspected impairments in:
- Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis response
- Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) sensitivity
- Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) responsiveness

### Core Mechanisms
- **Stabilization of dopamine and serotonin systems** → Recovery of unstable cortisol responses from HPA axis
- **Restoration of MR sensitivity** → Regulation of autonomic responses
- **Reduction of hypoglycemic shock risk** → Mitigation of nocturnal glucose crash peaks

---

## Target Patient Criteria

1. Irregular glucose spikes regardless of food intake
2. Delayed hypoglycemia recovery (suggesting delayed CRH activation and drop-phase patterns)
3. Fasting glucose that fluctuates without a clear pattern (requires CGM observation)
4. Postprandial glucose spikes before digestive absorption (possible psychological triggers)
5. Normal pancreatic/renal function with abnormal glycemic patterns
6. Patients with access to CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring)

## [Phase 1 – Recovery Strategy (3 to 5 weeks)]

### Morning Routine (Post-breakfast)
- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Support for neurochemical balance and monoamine metabolism
- **Rhodiola Rosea** – Modulation of excessive CRH response, adrenal support, enhances HPA reactivity
- **L-Theanine** – GABAergic calming, supports HPA buffering
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Antioxidant support, MR sensitivity recovery, immune balance
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** – Retinal/vascular protection, inflammation modulation
- **Metformin (Gemigliptin+)** – Suppresses hepatic glucose production, mitigates postprandial glucose spikes
- **Carnosine** – Inhibits lens glycation, ocular protection

> Recommend balanced carb-protein breakfast, light exposure, and light walking

### Evening Routine (Post-dinner)
- **Vitamin C, D3 (2nd dose)** – Oxidative stress reduction
- **Tryptophan (250–500mg)** – Promotes serotonin/melatonin synthesis, supports sleep
- **Tyrosine (250mg)** – Dopamine precursor, improves CRH response. Used in PM to prevent nocturnal neuroglucopenia; may shift to AM if no hypoglycemia risk
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Muscle relaxation, parasympathetic stabilization, sleep quality

> Recommend complex carb + protein dinner including blueberries, yogurt, and eggs

### Pre-Sleep Routine (0–60 min before bedtime)
- **Gr-8 (GRA8) class probiotics** – Stabilization of HPA-GBA (gut-brain axis) via microbiome modulation

> Take tryptophan and tyrosine at least 60 minutes apart; consume with warm water only

## Gr-8: Functional Contributions to HPA Stabilization by Strain

1. **Bifidobacterium longum (BI-05)** – Suppresses excessive CRH, restores cortisol rhythm, improves insulin sensitivity
2. **Lactobacillus rhamnosus (Lr-32)** – Enhances GABA receptor sensitivity, relieves stress, modulates HPA overactivation
3. **Bifidobacterium lactis (BI-04)** – Reduces inflammatory cytokines, strengthens gut lining, supports glucose metabolism
4. **Lactobacillus casei (Lc-11)** – Stabilizes dopamine levels, modulates small intestinal immune balance
5. **Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-14)** – Supports beneficial gut flora, enhances function of other strains
6. **Bifidobacterium bifidum (Bb-02)** – Suppresses TNF-α, reduces external autonomic stress signals
7. **Lactobacillus salivarius (Ls-33)** – Improves IgA response, supports oral-gut axis regulation
8. **Streptococcus thermophilus (St-21)** – Regulates gut pH, supports postprandial glucose stabilization

## Additional Supportive Recommendations

- **Onion peel tea** – Antioxidant and cholesterol regulation support
- **Blueberries** – Source of polyphenols, improves insulin sensitivity

---

## [Phase 2 – Stabilization Strategy (5 to 12 weeks)]

Applies when HbA1c improves and glucose spike patterns stabilize

### Morning Routine
- Maintain all supplements from Phase 1
- **Tyrosine** – Moved to morning due to reduced neuroglucopenic risk. Mitigates LAT1 competition with tryptophan

> Consult with physician before stopping or tapering metformin. If unstable, use metformin IR at night or XR in the following morning. Monitor for at least 3 days under CGM.

### Evening Routine
- Maintain all supplements from Phase 1
- Dinner snack becomes optional. Tyrosine moved to AM to reduce LAT1 transport competition

### Pre-Sleep Routine
- Continue probiotics (Gr-8) until strain colonization confirmed
- Avoid taking with zero-calorie drinks or on an empty stomach

---

## [Phase 3 – Drug Reduction Strategy (3 to 6 months)]

Applies when HbA1c and fasting glucose remain normal for over 2 weeks

### Morning Routine
- **Vitamin B6, B12** – Reduce to alternate days; high-dose long-term use may cause neural overstimulation
- **Rhodiola Rosea** – Gradually reduce and discontinue (e.g., low-dose, alternate-day taper)
- **L-Theanine** – Optional, but recommended
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Continue
- **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)** – Continue
- **Carnosine** – Continue (protects crystalline structures)
- **Tyrosine** – Gradually reduce and discontinue; consider dopamine depletion risk

### Evening Routine
- **Vitamin C, D3** – Continue
- **Tryptophan (250–500mg)** – Optional
- **Magnesium glycinate** – Occasional use
- **NAC (600mg)** – Optional; may support post-HPA recovery oxidative stress clearance (GI-tolerant, intermittent use)

> NAC complements carnosine; recommended only in Phase 3

### Pre-Sleep Routine
- **Gr-8 Probiotics** – Reduce to alternate days for maintenance
- Avoid zero-calorie drinks or fasting conditions before intake

This protocol is designed to support individual HPA-axis recovery. **All applications must be guided by medical professionals and CGM-based pattern monitoring.**

### Best-suited Patient Criteria:
- Documented HPA hypoactivity or CRH insensitivity
- Large fasting glucose fluctuations with non-meal-related spikes on CGM
- Normal pancreatic and renal evaluations, with strong psychological contributors suspected

### Therapeutic Targets:
1. Normalize cortisol feedback rhythm
2. Restore CRH responsiveness
3. Stabilize autonomic nervous system via MR regulation
